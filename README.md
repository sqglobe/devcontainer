# devcontainer

This project demonstrates a simple integration of a Docker container with VSCode.

The folder [.devcontainer](.devcontainer) contains all the files needed for VSCode to set up and start a development container. The image is specified by [ubuntu-oracular.docker](.devcontainer/ubuntu-oracular.docker).

[devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) provides settings for the IDE, such as required extensions and configurations. To use it, simply open the **devcontainer** folder with VSCode and select "Reopen in container".
